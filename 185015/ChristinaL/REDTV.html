	<h2> Theorys About RED (TV) singles</h2>
		<p> Taylor like 22 videos on tik tok, so 22(TV) might be the first single </p>
		<p> See below "what does her tweet mean about pushing up the albums release" </p>
		<p> She is already past the point she released love story (tv) was released in relation to fearless (tv), so there might not be any singles for red.</p>
		<p> The "from the vault" puzzle was a crossword, and one of her lyrics from the title track "red" is, "Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer" so "red" might be the lead single.</p>
	<h2> Theories about why she changed the release date </h2>
		<p> Possibly to make way for the new Adele album? </p>
	<H2> What does her tweet mean about pushing up the album's release? </h2>
<p> In her tweet about moving up the release about red, she said she wanted to celebrate the 13th with us, and she might have been talking about the 13th of October, which is a Wednesday, and one of her singles from the original red was "Begin Again", whose most famous lyric is "on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again" </p>
