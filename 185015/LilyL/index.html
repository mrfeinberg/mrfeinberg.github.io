	<tr> <th><p>Moths, mushrooms and magnolias galore! Welcome to the Flora and Fauna club
	where we explore all different types of animals, plants and insects. This club centers around 
	working with non-profit organizations to raise money for environmental sustainability projects
	and with non-profits working to save endangered species. Aside from this you will also learn
	about all different types of organisms and where to find them!
	Environmental sustainability is the core of this club and if you don't value this then 
	we are not the right fit for you; so get out. Next to this text you'll see an image of a 
	Polyphemus Moth, more commonly known as a Cramer. Click on the image and you'll receive 
	more information on it! (click on the left wing then the right) </p></th>
