	 <h2> *How to Become a Member* </h2> 
	</br> 
	<p> If you are interested in joining the high class slip 'n slide club, please 
	come talk to me as you will need to pass a series of tests. </p>
	</br>
	
	
	<h2> *Below are the trials you will have to face* </h2>
	 </br> 
<p>	 -First you have to pass a written test on the different ratings of slides. If the 
     majority of the club agrees with your statements, you pass. See the following link for
      <a href="SecondPage.html">reference</a></p>
<p>	 -Next you have to jump off of a standard high dive platform. Just for fun. </p>
<p>  -And finally you have to make a slip 'n slide out of the limited materials that 
	the club provides for you. These materials may include; duct tape, card board, a boot,
	wood chips, and a banana peel. </p>
	</br> 
	<p> **current members of the club shall not be held accountable to preform the trials
	ever </p>
  	</br>
  	<h2> *Requirements for Members* </h2> 
  	<p> All members will be required to have Wednesday and Saturday afternoons free as 
  	we will be traveling the country in search of the best slides. </p>  	
  	</center>
  	<p> The club members will also be required to slide down any slide I tell them to, in 
  	order to test for safety.</p> 
  	</br> </br>
