 <h3><i> Some Things About Me</h3></i>
  <p>This is about me, Ryne Whitt (RIEN WIT).</p>
  <p> I am new to Columbus Academy this year and I am a sophmore. I spent my freshman year attending Pickerington North High School. I play lacrosse for the Haymakers and I play football. I also enjoy boating, fishing, and just being on the water in general. I have never taken a computer science class before and I am excited to learn more about computers and how they work.</p>
