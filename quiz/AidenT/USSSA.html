    <center><h3> for a -10 bat, The DeMarini CF Zen is the best option. It isn't very durable,
    But it has the best bat speed and pop for USSSA. </h3>

    <h3> For a -8 bat, the 2024 Easton Hype Fire Is a great option for players who want
    great pop, durability, and bat speed. This bat is able to take low hits on the barrel
    very well. Your hands won't ring on low barrel hits.
