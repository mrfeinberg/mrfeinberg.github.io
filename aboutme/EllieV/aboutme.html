   <img src="BABYELLIE.JPG"/> </br>
   I am fourteen years old and I attend Columbus Academy, </br>
   
   I turn fifteen in October and get my temps in April. </br>
   This is my dog Conni, she is a four year old golden doodle, </br>
   
   and she was born six days after my tenth birthday. </br>

   so great, but that's not really a big deal because I don't
   care about it much, </br> 
   but I'm starting to like it so there's that </br>
