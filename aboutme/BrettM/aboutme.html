<center><h3><p> My name is Brett. It is my 11th year at Columbus Academy.<br/>
One of my favorite things to do is play Lacrosse!<br/>
During the summer time I play club lacrosse which I enjoy very much.
<br/>I also play lacrosse for the school during the spring lacrosse season.<br/>
This past season we became lacrosse state champs which was an awesome achievement!</p></h3></center>
