    <br>World War two was the one of the worst wars in history with an estimated death of 51 million,
     of which 15 million are military personnel, and 38 million civilians.</br>
    
    <br>But what were the main events that conspired before, during,
     and after the war that greatly affected the world?</br>
    
    <br>Most people have learned about World War 2 at some point of their lives,
     but did they know the full extent of what happened?</br>
    
    <br>Of the events that happened in the war, some stemmed from certain people,
     battles, and countries involved.</br>
    
    <br>Each of those topics have different experiences and have all affect the war in a different way,
    but all of them have contributed to the victory of the Allies,
    and have cause them to beat the Nazis.</br>
