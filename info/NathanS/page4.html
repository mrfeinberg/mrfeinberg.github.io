  <h1>The Country That Affect The War The Most</h1><hr>

   <br>It is well believed that either the United States, or the British were the countries that ended up affecting the war the most.</br>
   
   <br>But they are wrong.</br>
   
   <br>It is acknowledged by both of these countries that the Nazis would not have been defeated without the Soviet Union.</br>

   <br>The Soviet Union played a decisive role in defeating the Nazis, as Germany and Russia were right next to each other, it caused Germany to want to invade Russia.</br>
   
   <br>This caused Germany to be in a constant struggle with Russia since June 1941, when Germany attacked Russia. Even though Russia did not officially join the war until 1941,
   they had been harassing Poland after Germany had invaded their territory.
   
   <br>When Nazi Germany attacked Russia on June 22, 1941, Russia was entirely unprepared, and was entirely defeated.</br>
  
   <br>That is, until they were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941.</br>
   
   <br>Nazi Germany was unprepared for the cold winters of Russia, while the Russian soldiers were starting to take advantage of the cold weather and started pushing the Nazis back.</br>
   
   <br>Russia started pushing back the Nazis by dozens of miles at a time. And at the end, it was estimated that Germany had <b>1,419,728 dead, and 997,056 missing </b>, a total of <b>18%</b> of all of Germany's troops.</br>
   
   <br>It is also to be stated that the Soviet Union suffered the highest number of deaths of any single nation during the war, with estimates around 22 and 27 million deaths.</br>
