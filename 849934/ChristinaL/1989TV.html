	<h2> Theories About 1989 (TV) </h2>
		<ul> Taylor might collab with the Jonas brothers on 1989 (TV).  This is because nick Jonas posted a tik tok with wildest dreams (TV) while eating a piece of pizza, and Taylor commented "iconic &#127829;". Joe Jonas then posted on his story on Instagram, with welcome to new york behind it. The Jonas Brothers also released a song called pizza girl in 2012, and Taylor used a piece of pizza on her "vision board" she brought to the late show with Stephen Colbert. In that same interview, she dropped many hints for 1989, she told steven to "shake it off" and said he was "44 years old and 179 days old when she recorded the song hey Stephen. that date doesn't add up to how old he was when she recorded the original fearless, or when she released fearless. 44 years and179 days before when that interview aired was however on October 27th, and she released 1989 on October 27th, 2014. Nick Jonas later in a tik tok ate a bag of chip that reads "est. 1989". Jo Jonas also posted a tik tok with should've said no behind it. It also would not be uncommon for Taylor to collab with one of her exes as she is (unconfirmed) featuring Harry Styles on Style (TV).

	<h2> Theories about why she released wildest dreams</h2>
		<ul> this might be signaling that there are no distinct eras in Taylor's Version time. she might simply be in one giant Taylors Version era, instead of revisiting her red era, and then 1989. </ul>
		<ul> It also could be purely business. The song was getting a lot of streams from a tik tok trend, so it makes sense from a business perspective to just release it as a single. </ul>
		<ul> In her announcement of red (tv) she said "I've always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different axis, at a different speed. Time skips backward and forwards fleetingly...In the land of heartbreak, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven together with grief, paralyzing vulnerability, and hopelessness. Imagine your future might always take you on a detour back to the past." This could be hinting that the red era and the 1989 era are being merged together and we will be getting singles from both at the same time.</ul>
	<H2> Theories about Taylor Nation's #WhatEraAreWeIn for Fearless (TV) vinyls</h2> 
		<ul>  This could just be Taylor nation trying to fit in with the swifties by poking fun at themselves. </ul>
		<ul> This could also be signaling that her previous eras will all be blended into one "Taylors version" era. </ul>
