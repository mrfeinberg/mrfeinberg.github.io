	<tr> <td> <img src="flatslide.jpg" width="400"/> <td style="width:50%;">
	<p>3.5/10</p>
	<p> Flat </p>
	<p> Looks like it hurts </p>
	<p> Would need extra supplies like dish soap
	<p> What if there is a giant rock under the tarp? </p>
	<p> Points off for being cheap, but some for being long </p> </td> </tr>
	
	
	<tr> <td><img src="ultimateslide.jpg" width="400"/></td> 
	<td> <p> 8/10 </p>
	<p> Amazing slide </p> 
	<p> Imagine the momentum! </p>
	<p> Only downside would be there is no body of water at the end </p>
	<p> Might slide off and hit the grass </p>
	<p> Climbing up that ladder is spectacular too </p>
	<p> Very high class </p> </td> </tr>
	
	
	<tr> <td><img src="slip1.jpg" width="400"/></td> 
	<td> <p> 6.5/10 </p>
	<p> Lacks the X factor 
	<p> Color combination is not nice </p>
	<p> Slide looks fun </p>
	<p> Ladder looks steep enough to be fun </p>
	<p> Although the bottom part of the slide is too long and flat </p>
	<p> Wouldn't get fast enough to hit the inflatable wall at the bottom</p>
	</td> </tr>
	
	
	<tr> <td><img src="tropical.jpg" width="400"/></td> 
	<td> <p> 100/10! </p>
	<p> Everything about this slide is perfect </p>
	<p> Look at that pool at the bottom! </p>
	<p> AMAZING slide, you could slide for minutes </p>
	<p> Not part of the slide, but look at the water park next to it! (10/10)
	<p> Only downside would be walking back up after sliding, but its worth it </p>
	<p> Love the color scheme </p></td> </tr>
